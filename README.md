# Flutterrific

App made during an eight hour hackaton: [#Hack19](https://flutterhackathon.com/).

## Idea
 - Developers may upload their apps to the service.
 - A user get presented with a submitted app and may like or skip it.
 - Users has access to an archive of liked apps, as well as skipped ones.

## State as of the deadline
 - Users may browse three predefined apps.
 - See more details about each app.
 - Links to GitHub, App Store and Google Play.

## Limitations
We had many great ideas, but not every idea got implemented due to the time constraint.

 - No way to mark a submitted app as liked in the app.
 - No back-end service for users and their liked apps.
 - No back-end service for fetching and submitting new apps.
 - No archive.
